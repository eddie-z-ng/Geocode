Geocode and Map Lookup Demo:
-Enter a business, point of interest, address, etc. and autocomplete will populate with choices
-Selecting the autocompleted place via keyboard or mouse click results in an overhead map view 
centered at the location and a streetview panorama located close to the place, if available. 
Information window appears with address and recommended website, if available.
-Entering a non-autocompleted address for search will result in reverse geocoding to center the
overhead map and a streetview panorama located close to the address.
-Weather, traffic, transit, and panoramio layers may be added to the the overhead map at any time
via the buttoms underneath the search box
